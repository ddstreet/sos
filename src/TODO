To Do List:

 * Gather statistics (time, files collected, commands run) per plugin

 * Choose sane defaults to satisfy Red Hat support requirements (ie. what
   plugins should be loaded by default, with what options, etc)

 * Make sosreport a drop-in replacement for sysreport

 * Allow to use a different rootdir than /

 * Add support for distributions other than Fedora.

 * Make it easier to select a policy module and perhaps optionally include
   plugins from the library, to allow per-distribution customization.

 * Documentation - plugin howto doc, inline doc in plugin template

 * Review and test error handling for things like a full tmp file system
