To Do List:

Add support for distributions other than Fedora.

Make it easier to select a policy module and perhaps optionally include
plugins from the library, to allow per-distribution customization.

Documentation - plugin howto doc, inline doc in plugin template

review and test error handling for things like a full tmp file system
